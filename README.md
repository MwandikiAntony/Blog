# MERN Blog Platform

## Overview

A personal blog platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), allowing users to create, edit, and publish blog posts. This platform provides a simple yet powerful interface for managing blog content, and is designed with ease of use and scalability in mind.

## Installation & Deployment

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-blog-platform.git
   cd backend
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Set up your MongoDB URI in the .env file:

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your MongoDB URI and port configuration:

ini
Copy
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
npm start
Your backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Start the frontend:

bash
Copy
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Additional Notes
The backend API will be running on http://localhost:5000/api/posts, and the frontend will interact with this API to fetch and display blog posts.
Make sure MongoDB is properly configured and running. If you don't have a MongoDB instance, you can use services like MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based MongoDB hosting.
For production deployment, you may need to configure environment variables and deployment services like Render (for backend) and Vercel (for frontend).
